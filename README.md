# Maze 0x72
This is a remake of the [original Maze0x72](https://github.com/LucasBremm/Maze0x72), a Unity game made to practice game development. The game is very simple, the idea is to find the key that opens the door by exploring the maze. It has several possible locations for key spawning, once you got the key, just go to the door to exit the maze.

Special thanks to [0x72](https://0x72.itch.io/) for the assets used to make this game.
