This is a Unity game made to practice game development. I intend to increment it a little bit more, with enemies and things like that.

The game is very simple, the idea is to find the key that opens the door by exploring the maze. It has 5 possible locations for key spawning, once you got the key, just go to the door to exit the maze.

Special thanks to [0x72](https://0x72.itch.io/) for the assets used to make this game.

The game can be played on [Itch](https://lucas-bremm.itch.io/maze-0x72), where I published it in my account.
