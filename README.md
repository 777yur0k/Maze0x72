This is a Unity game made to practice game development. I intend to increment it a little bit more, with enemies and things like that.

There are some issues to be solved too, like being stuck on walls and too tiny gaps on the maze.

Special thanks to [0x72](https://0x72.itch.io/) for the assets used to make this game.

The game can be played on [Itch](https://lucas-bremm.itch.io/maze-0x72), where I published it in my account.
